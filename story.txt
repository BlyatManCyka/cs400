A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
With Zeus stepping down from heaven's gate, the earth starts to shiver, the sky start to tremble, and the waves rising from the sea. The planet celebrate his entrance to the mortal wold with the biggest show that it can possibly offer.
However, there were a few that dispised his enterance. They cursed his name and vowed to destroy the festival by any means necessary. The soured the vintage, raided the supplies and left the organizers with little to work with. Because of this, the organizers had no other choice but to go to Zeus himself. Zeus upon hearing this smited the wrongdoers and the festival went off without a hitch.
